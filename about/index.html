	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I grew up in Puyallup, Washington and studied bioengineering at the University of Washington. In 2014 I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia where I entered the University of Virginia Biomedical Engineering PhD program.</p>
	<p>I am currently in Dr. Jason Papin's <a href="http://bme.virginia.edu/csbl/"> Computational Systems Biology Laboratory</a>, where I study metabolism in microbial communities. One of my primary interests is advancing the tractability of hypothesis testing with gnotobiotic animals (animals colonized with a defined, limited set of microbes), such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Schaedler_flora"> altered Schaedler flora</a>.
	</p>
	<p>I was initially drawn to science through exercise, and  I maintain this interest by training and competing in powerlifting. You can find my competition results <a href="http://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=16302"> here</a>.
