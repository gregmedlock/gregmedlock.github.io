	<h1>Hello, I am Greg Medlock</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia, where I am advised by Dr. Jason Papin.<p>
	<p>I am broadly interested in quantitative modeling of biological systems and how interactions at small scales (e.g. molecular interactions between a protein and another compound) lead to the actions we interpret at larger scales (e.g. growth and division of bacterial cells).</p>
  <p>I use this blog to share and learn about technical aspects of my field of research and ways to "do science". Blog posts may span a large range of "meta"-ness, from notes about interactions between science and society to useful snippets of code, with a few posts about my hobbies peppered in.</p>
