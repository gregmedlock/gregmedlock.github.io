	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia, where I am advised by Dr. Jason Papin. I am broadly interested in quantitative modeling of biological systems and how interactions at small scales (e.g. molecular interactions between a protein and another compound) lead to the actions we interpret at larger scales (e.g. growth and division of bacterial cells).<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
